- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?

Inheritance is really cool because it allows you to use attributes from other classes without having to repeat so much code. I think it's most useful when you're dealing with two classes that share some similar attributes, but also need to be able to accomplish different things (like the cafe and the library). Inheritance also gives you control over what you want to keep and what you want to change, which I thought was really interesting.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
I found this that this assignment was one of the most enjoyable for me, because I could see how the different inheritance aspects worked in real time. I liked being able to build a few different classes so I could get a hang for how inheritance works on a very basic level and also notice patterns among what I was doing for each class. I would give future students the advice to have fun with this assignment and not overthink it, since it's more about grasping the conceptual idea of inheritance than writing any super complicated code.
